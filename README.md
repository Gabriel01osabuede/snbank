**What the Program Does**

Like The program title suggests this is a 
banking app
thats has staff stored in a file called **staff.txt** that when the program is run the user needs to supply
the **staff Username and staff password** if these details are wrong you will be required to put in the right details b4 proceeding to the next face of the app
,also there is a **customer.txt** file that stores the customer essential detail if the customer wants to 
open a new account number
then a random 10 digits account number is provided when the details are all fixed.
also during this process a **session.txt** file is created to record the time the user logs into the app.
and lastly when the user choose to logs out the **session.txt** file is deleted
and returns to the log-in page.
To test all of these functionality.
